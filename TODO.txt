Figure out why the last scene, 'first_script', was looping a few times: this appears to stem from looks like the "In the browser" choice adding extra scene-runs or the like.

Replace the "game" singleton object with better pre-feature code support instead, if actually preferable.

Refactor the features and steps to expect *only* certain content so as to avoid unexpected content.

FINISH improving the text-based interface used by the tutorial, including better prompts, prompts that require specific options, fix the choice defaulting or make it intentional, and add features for all of this!

Add some introspective Ruby class > JS object export code for automatic mitigation of changes. 
Ex:
class StageElement
	attr_accessor :name
end

function StageElement(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Move some more of the implicit things (like always running the :intro scene first if provided) into the feature lists.

Consider ways to keep the tutorial script and its final product results DRYer.
