In JS: Figure out why, after making and seeing the results of a choice, it still then runs the second choice (potential repeat).

Replace the "game" singleton object with better pre-feature code support instead, if actually preferable.

Refactor the features and steps to expect *only* certain content so as to avoid unexpected content.

FINISH improving the text-based interface used by the tutorial, including better prompts, prompts that require specific options, fix the choice defaulting or make it intentional, and add features for all of this!

Add "in_function" convenience method for "function(){}" generation and auto-indentation.
