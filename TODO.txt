Figure out why the last scene, 'first_script', was looping a few times.

Consider switching out the "show <obj>, :<adj>" format of the command with "show [<adj>] <char> [statement/action]", making the adjective a method instead of a symbol and adding the statement/action at the end.  This would make combined image-statement commands more natural.  Ex:
show tired lucy "flops onto her bed."

Replace the "game" singleton object with better pre-feature code support instead, if actually preferable.

Refactor the features and steps to expect *only* certain content so as to avoid unexpected content.

FINISH improving the text-based interface used by the tutorial, including better prompts, prompts that require specific options, fix the choice defaulting or make it intentional, and add features for all of this!

Add some introspective Ruby class > JS object export code for automatic mitigation of changes. 
Ex:
class StageElement
	attr_accessor :name
end

function StageElement(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Move some more of the implicit things (like always running the :intro scene first if provided) into the feature lists.
